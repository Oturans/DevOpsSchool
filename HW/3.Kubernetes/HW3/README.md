## HomeWork part #1 (./Task1)
• Create namespace monitoring   
• Create service account grabber in that namespace  
• Create role that can get, list, watch on all Pods in t he cluster  

## HomeWork part #2 (./Task2)
• Deploy any Stateful application on Kubernetes as StatefulSet. If you have no ideas, you can use minio.  

## HomeWork part #3 (./Task3)
1. Complete chart of the simple application from the lecture. It should be configurable with 
values. At least you should implement:  
• Number of replicas  
• Labels  
• Network ports  
• Resource names should have similar pattern, for example app-svc and app-ingress  
• Resources (it should be optional)  
2. Any other change that will make code cleaner and avoid repetition
